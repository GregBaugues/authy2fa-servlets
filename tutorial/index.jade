    ## About this application

    This [Java Servlets](//docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/bnafd.html)
    sample application demonstrates two-factor authentication (2FA) using Authy.
    To run this sample app yourself, [download the code and follow the
    instructions on GitHub](https://github.com/TwilioDevEd/authy2fa-servlets).

    Adding 2FA to your web application increases the security of your user's
    data. [Multi-factor
    authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication)
    determines the identity of a user by validating once by logging into the
    app, and second by validating their mobile device.

    For the second factor, we will validate that the user has their mobile phone by either:

    * Sending them a OneTouch push notification to their mobile Authy app or
    * Sending them a token through their mobile Authy app or
    * Sending them a one-time token in a text message [sent with Authy via
    Twilio](http://www.authy.com/). Here's how this works at a high level:

    ## Configuring Authy

    If you haven't already, now is the time to [sign up for
    Authy](https://dashboard.authy.com/signup). Create your first application,
    naming it whatever you wish. After you create your application, your
    "production" API key will be visible on your
    [dashboard](https://dashboard.authy.com):

    Once we have an Authy API key, we set it as an environment variable.
